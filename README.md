# Portfolio Website:

## Premise: 
A website to house the coding portfolio of Sarah Knego, as well as provide a space to get in contact with her.

## Technologies Used: 
This project was completed using NextJS and Builder.io.


## What does it do: This website stores data on the projects and displays them, both in a general page and individual project pages, and links to the projectsâ€™ webpages. The homepage also links to certifications achieved in Javascript and Responsive Web Design. There is also a short bio and a form made to get in contact with Sarah.

## Challenges Faced: 
I learned both Builder and NextJS for this project, so it was a bit of a challenge to learn two new technologies at once. Additionally, there were occasional setbacks with pages refusing to load, which took some trial and error to fix. The styling of the side/background images took some work to get right as well, in regards to the positioning, sizing, and opacity of each.
